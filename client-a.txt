Initialize the start of the game by print string "The Magic Number Game"
The application will set the magic_number to a random integer between 1 and 10
Set the total number of attempts to 3
Set attempts to 0
Set player guess to 0
Print string "Riddle me, Riddle me, Ree, guess the magic number, your attempts are only 3!"
Set loop to 3 while attempts < total attempts
Get the player attempt
Print string "What is my magic number between 1 and 10?"
Player inputs integer =>1 and <=10 
If player input is not an integer =>1 and <=10 print string "please make sure the number is between 1-10"
If integer is an integer =>1 and <=10, then check number
If number is = to the magic_number print string "You are MAGIC!" Exit the loop
If number is not equal to the magic_number print string "Guess again, friend!" Continue loop until 3 attempts
After 3 incorrect attempts print string "Oh me, Oh me, your attempts have reached 3!  Try again later!"
End game
